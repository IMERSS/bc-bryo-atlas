## Distinguishing Features

A seemingly rare species of montane old growth forest near the coast, you could be forgiven for overlooking this tiny, appressed yellow-red epiphyte that forms cm-scale patches of distantly-spaced stems on fir and alder bark. Up close, the leaves do not overlap, and on the underside with a good hand lens in good light, you should be able to make out a relatively large round &quot;lobule&quot; (see photo) that is almost the same size as the overlying upper leaf lobe.

## Similar species

On account of its small size and pinkish hues, this is unlikely to be mistaken for another genus or species, though Radula bolanderi can grow in similar habitats and can present itself as a small epiphyte with distantly spaced leaves. R. bolanderi, however, is always pale green and lacks the elaborate lobule and underleaf arrangement of F. hattoriana. F. hattoriana is a plant of montane old-growth forests and as such does not overlap in habitat with other Frullania species in the region. None of those other species have a &quot;lobule&quot; that approaches the size of its overlying upper leaf lobe.

## Habitat

Tree trunks (esp. Mountain Hemlock, Yellow-cedar, alder) and branches in the montane and subalpine zones; rare in coastal and se [Mica Creek] BC.

## Associated species

Ulota obtusiloba, Hypnum circinale
