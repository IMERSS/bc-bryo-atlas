## Distinguishing Features

An occasional giant (up to 1 cm wide) of very wet and peaty coniferous forest, this west coast endemic has wide spreading, elongate and deep green leaves fringed in places by reddish margins and burgandy stems. Both the small upper lobe and the larger lower leaf lobe, toothed and rounded are much longer than wide. On the underside in good light, you should be able to make out a red fringed leaf base running along the stem like a toothy zipper.

## Similar species

Species of Diplophyllum have the same leaf form but are half the size (&lt;&lt;5mm) and lack the red and purple fringes. Species of Scapania, especially S. bolanderi, can grow in the same habitat and on the same substrates, but their leaf lobes have a round aspect, whereas those of M. rubrum are much longer than wide. No other species in the genus Macrodiplophyllum has the sharp red pigmentation and big, toothy margins of M. rubrum.

## Habitat

Decayed wood, tree trunks, peatlands, and humus, especially in coniferous forests, in the lowland zone; frequent in coastal BC.
