## Distinguishing Features

A common yellowish-green to more often green moss that may grow in large clumps. When fresh with large, oval to near rounded leaves, shiny with a strong mid-vein and smooth margins. Has smooth red stems, and where present drooping sporophytes. When dry the leaves take on a darker green, more translucent habit.

## Similar species

Plagiomnium and Mnium are similar but they have toothed leaves. Rhizomnium magnifolium is the most similar but has hairy stems and bigger leaves.

## Habitat

Rotting wood, soil, and rock with thin soil, in coniferous forests, most frequently at low elevations but extending to near alpine. Common especially in coastal areas and also in wet interior regions.

## Associated species
