## Distinguishing Features

An occasional species of exposed rocks, P. roelli is typically a yellow-brownish and glossy plant that has branches few and far between. From the underside with a hand lens, the underlobes are narrower than the underleaf (see photo). Many describe this species as having a &quot;peppery&quot; taste compared to other Porella species, though it should not be consumed.

## Similar species

The typical rock habitat, glossy, little-branched shoots and narrow underleaves distinguish P. roellii from P. navicularis, with its wide underleaf, and P. cordaeana, with its matte shoots.

## Habitat

Dry to mesic, shady rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, tree trunks (esp. deciduous trees), and occasionally decayed wood, humus, and mineral soil in the lowland and montane zones; frequent in coastal BC, rare in c [Smithers area] and se BC.
