## Distinguishing Features

An infrequent species of higher elevation, M. imbricatum is a yellow or yellow brown robust rock and tundra dweller with smooth lobe margins and an upper lobe oriented at ~ 45 degrees to the stem. It is distinct in having nearly equal upper and lower leaf lobes and a reduced, obscured keel connecting them along their lower margin.

## Similar species

In the montane to alpine habitat where this species thrives, it is unlikely to be mistaken for many other species on account of its girth and closely overlapping leaves. Some species of Scapania (eg. Scapania subalpina) occuring in the same habitats also have smooth, nearly equal lobes, but in M. imbricatum the lobes are elongate and lack the obvious &quot;keel&quot; that connect the upper and lober lobes at their base.

## Habitat

Moist, often shady rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, heath, and tundra in the montane, subalpine, and alpine zones; infrequent in wc BC [esp. Haida Gwaii], rare in sw, c [Hudson Bay Mtn.], and nw [Haines Triangle] BC.
