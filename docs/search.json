Geocalyx graveolens does can have nearly identical leaf attachment and shape, but its leaves are consistent in shape along the stem and its lobe tips are always triangular, while leaves of L. heterophylla are variable in shape as you move along the stem, often without lobes or having lobes that are more blunt or more acute than those found in Geocalyx. Species of Mesoptychia (especially M. gillmanii) can show similair leaf shape, but leaves in that genus are attached across the axis of the stem, not along it, and underleaves are unlobed, whereas in L. heterophylla, they are bilobed. Within its genus, L. minor is smaller and has leaves with regularly rounded lobes covered in asexual spores (\"gemmae\"), while L. heterophylla has leaves that vary in form as you move along the stem and lacks gemmae.

Close inspection with a hand lens should show lateral leaves are similair with 3 to 4 sharply-tipped lobes that widen from 1 cell at their apex to 2 cells at their bottom before joining to a wide leaf base that is attached to the stem at 90 degrees. Underleaves are present but have only 1 or 2 well developed lobes.\n\nSimilar species\n\nSee notes under Kurzia makinoana. In order be certain you have K. trichoclados and not K. makinoana, you will need to look for specialized structures that bear the antheridia (Androecia) and archegonia (\"Gynoecia\") (see photos). In K. makinoana, the tips of the leaves surrounding the archegonia have hair-like cells (\"cilia\"), while the tips of the leaves surrounding the antheridia have two lobes. This is in contrast to K. trichoclados, where leaves of the gynoecia are toothed (no hair-like cells) and those of the androecia have three lobes.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, bogs, peatlands, and occasionally decayed wood in the lowland zone\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzia trichoclados plate"

With a hand lens, the 3-4-lobes of each leaf are sharply tipped, converging at a leaf base that diverges from the stem at 90 degrees. In order confidently identify this species, a microscope is neccessary to observe the underleaves, which are typically reduced to 1-2 lobes accompanied by 1-2 amorphous bumps (\"slime papillae\"– see photograph).\n\nSimilar species\n\nSorting out species of Kurzia is always going to require high magnification on account of their small size. On account of its small size and tiny, almost filamentous leaf-lobes, K. makinoana can be mistaken for species of Blepharostoma or Lepidozia, both of which can occur in the same habitats. Blepharostoma species have leaf lobes that are 1-cell wide and divided completely to the base of the leaf. In K. makinoana, the lobes are 1-celled at their tip but broaden to 2 (or more) cells towards their base, which is found at about three-quarters down the leaf’s length. Lepidozia species have 3-4 lobed lateral leaves, the leaf itself being divided only to about 1/2 its length into lobes that are 4+ cells wide at their base. Kurzia pauciflora is a species exclusive to open bogs and has 4-lobed underleaves compared to the wider ecological range and 1-2 lobed underleaves of K. makinoana. Distinguishing K. trichoclados requires microscopic examination of the ornamentation of the leaves surrounding the developing reproductive organs.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, decayed wood, seepage sites, streambanks, peatlands, bogs, and swamps in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzia makinoana plate"

In the family Cephaloziaceae, only F. connivens and F. lunulifolia exhibit leaves that attach down the length of the stem as in F. pleniceps.

The tips of the lateral leaves are rounded or blunt, occasionally with a shallow and round notch, while the underleaves are very narrow but discernably two-lobed with a hand lens.

Gyrothyra underwoodiana is a species of wet banks with similair leaves and leaf attchment, but its undersides have a characteristic set of discrete purple \"pads\" that are absent in Chiloscyphus pallescens. Species of Jungermannia and Solenostoma have simple leaves, but they are attached at a more oblique angle and both genera lack the underleaves of Chiloscyphus. Species of Plagiochila can have similair oblique-longitudinal attachment of unlobed leaves, but those leaves typically have teeth and the plants never have an underleaf. C. pallescens has an underleaf and its leaves are unadorned. Lophocolea heterophylla typically has leaves showing variable degrees of lobing along the length of the stem, but when the leaves are unlobed, they can look like Chiloscyphus, but C. pallescens does not show much variation in leaf form along the stem. Chiloscyphus polyanthos has leaves and stems that are morphologically indistinguishable from C. pallescens. Close inspection of the leaves surrounding the archegonia in fertile material should show smooth leaf margins in the former and teeth on the latter, while microscopic examination will show most leaf cells of C. polyanthos have 2 oil bodies, while those of C. pallescens mostly have 2 oil bodies.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, decayed wood, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, and seepage sites, often submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChiloscyphus polyanthos plate"

The arched lateral leaves have three very shallow tooth-like lobes (&lt;1/10th leaf length) at their tips, while the underleaves are wider than long with 3-4 lobes with rounded tips. The naked shoot sections stand out in particular, especially on plants found in extensive carpets on conifer trunks, stumps and logs.\n\nSimilar species\n\nThe evenly-forked shoots and notch-like lobes at the tip of the lateral leaves make it unlike any species outside its own genus, though Calypogiea species are often found in the same habitat and can mimic the leaf form. Bazzania denudata has 3-4 lobes on its underleaf, however, while species of Calypogeia have 2 at most. B. tricrenata and B. griffithiana are brown-to-yellow species with significantly longer shoots (&gt;3 cm). Bazzania trilobata is emerald green like B. denudata, but the shoots are much wider (3-6 mm vs. 2 mm) and its underleaves have toothed crests, not rounded ones. B. pearsonii, a species of similar size and colour to B. denudata, has unlobed underleaves. Bazzania ambigua typically shows 2-lobed lateral leaves and underleaves that are as long as wide, while B. denudata has (typically) 3-lobed lateral leaves and underleaves that are wider than long. If uncertain, check the lateral leaves with a microscope: oil bodies are 8-12 in B. denudata and 2-4 in B. ambigua.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet, often shady rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, boulders, humus, mineral soil, and decayed wood in the lowland and montane zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nLepidozia reptans, Cephalozia bicuspidata, Calypogeia sp., Scapania bolanderei, Tetraphis pellucida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBazzania denudata plate"

Under a microscope, it can be immediately separated from all of these by the uniformly thick cell walls and, especially, the concentric rows of quadrate to rectangular cells emanating from the leaf lobe tips (other species with irregularly placed, usually rounded cells). Macroscopically, it may be confused with Barbilophozia sudetica, but is distinguished by the placement of leaves around the stem rather than often primarily on one side (i.e., secund). Differs from Sphenolobus saxicola, a rare species of far northwestern BC, in its smaller size (shoots 0.4-1.5 mm wide, vs. 1.2-3 mm wide in S. saxicola), slightly smaller leaves (0.4-0.7 mm, vs. 0.5-0.8 mm in S. saxicola), and occasional presence of gemmae (always lacking in S. saxicola). Anastrophyllum assimile is also similar to S. minutum, but is a darker blackish to blackish-brown colour and the dorsal lobe of the leaves is slightly decurrent along the stem.\n\nHabitat\n\nWide variety of wet to mesic, open to shaded habitats, but most frequent on acidic rocks, cliffs, and ledges; also terrestrial in subalpine heath, on peaty slopes, or on hummocks in bogs.

The erect shoots with two rows of round, concave and unlobed leaves converging towards a shoot tip typically bedazzled with bright yellow or red gemmae is unique amongst regional leafy liverworts. Up close, you should also be able to make out a simple, round underleaf similair in size and shape to the lateral leaves.\n\nSimilar species\n\nUnlobed leaves in nearly opposite arrangement are found in Jungermannia, Solenostoma, Cryptocolea, Nardia and Mylia, all of which can occur in similar habitats. Of these genera, only Nardia has an underleaf as in O. denudata, but if the former the underleaf is small and narrow, whilst in the latter it is large and round. O. elongatum has a similair leaf arrangement, but the plant is darkly pigmented and lacks gemmae atop its reclined shoots in contrast to the bright hues, erect shoots and apical gemmae of O. denudatum. O. sphagnicola is very similar but lacks gemmae and has pale thread like branches that emerge from the stem that are absent in O. denudatum. Arctic-alpine O. macounii occurs in very different habitat and lacks the pigmentation of O. denudatum.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to mesic humus, decayed wood, cliffs, crevices, ledges, peatlands, bogs, tundra, and occasionally tree bases in the lowland, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdontoschisma denudatum plate"

Yanked from their substrate, the shoots are long (up to 3 cm), with the simple, unlobed leaves attaching obliquely to the stem and becoming more distantly spaced as you move down.\n\nSimilar species\n\nThis is the only large simple-leaved liverwort that grows exclusively through Sphagnum and has abundant yellow-green gemmae. The presence of prominent simple underleaves seperates it from Cryptocolea, Syzygiella, Jungermannia and Solenostoma. Because of its restriction to bog-like habitats, it could only be mistaken for the much smaller species of Odontoschisma (&lt;&lt;1 mm wide) or its brethren, Mylia taylorii. The latter species has leaves wider than long with rounded leaf tips topped by bright yellow-red gemmae, while those of M. anomala are longer than wide, with somewhat pointed leaf tips topped by light green gemmae.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, bogs, swamps, peatlands, and occasionally decayed wood in the lowland and montane zones\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMylia anomala plate"

The simple round leaves appear in nearly an opposite arrangement, evenly spaced down the shoot but tightly converging near the tip so as to appear like a set of nested lips. Asexual reproductive bodies (\"gemmae\") are frequent and brightly coloured yellow and red, while underleaves are simple and elongate.\n\nSimilar species\n\nIn the pantheon of unlobed leafy liverworts, M. taylorii is distinguished from species of Cryptocolea, Syzygiella, Jungermannia and Solenostoma by its prominent underleaf, a feature absent or minute in those genera. Gyrothyra underwoodiana has the same widespreading and subopposite leave arrangement, but its underleaf is two-lobed and the undersides of the stem have recurrent purple patches in contrast to the to M. taylorii where such patches are absent and the underleaves are unlobed. Odontoschisma species can have a similair leaf form and arrangement, but they are usually less than 1 mm wide and 1 cm long and the leaves themselves are very concave. M. taylorii is a much bigger plant and its leaves are plane, not concave. Nardia has shoots that can show the nested lip arrangement of rounded leaves seen in M. taylorii, but it never has gemmae and its underleaf, while similair in shape, is attached to the base of the lateral leaves. In M. taylorii, the underleaves are free from the lateral leaves and gemmae are very common. Mylia taylorii has leaves wider than long with rounded leaf tips topped by bright yellow-red gemmae, while those of M. anomala are longer than wide, with somewhat pointed leaf tips topped by light green gemmae.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, rock outcrops, boulders, bogs, peatlands, seepage areas, decayed wood, waterfall spray zones, and rarely tree bases in the lowland and montane zones\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMylia taylorii plate"

The leaves are best interpretted from the underside, where a large upper lobe can be seen behind a smaller, triangular underlobe that is similar in size and shape to an overlapping underleaf. Male plants have small rattle-like shoots that bear antheridia, while the sporophytes develop from modified, archegonia-bearing leaves on the underside of the main stem of female plants.\n\nSimilar species\n\nSometimes this species can be confused for a large Radula on account of the tightly overlapping, rounded leaves. Looking at the underside of both plants with a hand lens, you will see that Radula lacks an underleaf. Frullania species are smaller, but absent that, the genus has sphaeroidal, helmet shaped lobules as opposed to the triangular underlobes seen in P. navicularis. The glossy leaves in combination with underlobes that are similair in size and shape distinguish P. navicularis from matte P. cordaeana and similarly-glossy P. roellii, both species with underlobes that are narrower than the underleaves.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to dry rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, cutbanks, tree trunks (esp. deciduous trees), and decayed wood in the lowland and montane zones; common in coastal BC, rare in sc, se, and nw BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorella navicularis plate"

The margins are frequently populated by round gemmae (see photo) and the undersides lack underleaves but are marked by a small pocket at the base of the leaf.

Typically tightly appressed to decaying conifers and organic-rich soils, this species can be confirmed by hand lens examination of the underleaf, which should show two lobes that are divided to about half of their length. Like many species in the genus, C. mulleriana frequently has gemmae-bearing shoots that have more distant leaves and erect shoot apices with light-green clusters of asexual spores.\n\nSimilar species\n\nCalypogeia mulleriana is unlikely to be confused with any other genus of leafy liverworts with the exception of Bazzania, which can show similair shingle-like arrangement of leaves. That genus, however, has leaves that have tooth-like notches at the tips and underleaves with more than two lobes. The green, rounded leaves and evenly two-lobed underleaves of C. mulleriana are similair to many species in the genus Calypogeia, but can be distinguished from other species with a hand lens. Plants of C. azurea have identical leaves and underleaves, but have a blue hue, while C. sphagnicola has leaves that are triangular in shape and do not overlap, whereas leaves in C. mulleriana are round and tightly overlap. C. integrispula and C. neesiana have unlobed underleaves and C. fissa has an underleaf dissected almost all the way to its base, while the underleaf in C. mulleriana is only dissected to about half of its length. C. suecica, a rare species of wet wood, is very small (typically &lt;1 mm wide) and has somewhat pointed underleaves relative to the rounded underleaves of C. meulleriana, which occur on shoots typically &gt;2 mm wide.\n\nHabitat\n\nDecaying wood and organic rich soil banks in forests\n\nAssociated species\n\nLepidozia reptans, Bazzania denudata, Tetraphis pellucidam Pseudotaxiphyllum elegans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalypogeia muelleriana plate"

Eremonotus myriocarpus is very similar in size, leaf shape and threadlike growth habit. It grows in the very specific habitat of damp vertical rock, but otherwise requires granular examination of the shoots to compare leaf shapes and reproductive structures- see photos under that species.

The tips of the lateral leaves are rounded or blunt, occasionally with a shallow and round notch, while the underleaves are very narrow but discernably two-lobed with a hand lens.

C. pallescens has an underleaf and its leaves are unadorned. Lophocolea heterophylla typically has leaves showing variable degrees of lobing along the length of the stem, but when the leaves are unlobed, they can look like Chiloscyphus, but C. pallescens does not show much variation in leaf form along the stem. Chiloscyphus polyanthos has leaves and stems that are morphologically indistinguishable from C. pallescens.

From above, the plant is composed of tightly overlapping, round upper lobes on their leaves.

Likewise, Radula can also grow as a small epiphyte growing close to the bark, but in that genus, there is no \"lobule\", nor is there the prominent underleaf found in species of Frullania. F. nisquallensis is the \"largest\" species in the genus, but could be mistaken for similar epiphytic forms of F. californica and rock-dwelling Frullania franciscana.

While its lateral leaves have the genus’ characteristic 3-4 triangular lobes down to about 1/2 their length, they are narrower than the shoot width and very widely spaced along the stems. As the Latin name suggests, this is a plant with an interesting distribution, known predominantly from the Hawaiian Islands and wet-coastal British Columbia.\n\nSimilar species\n\nBecause of its large size and shoots growing free from their substrate, it is unlikely to be mistaken for other liverworts with leaves narrower than their stems (eg. species of Cephalozia and Cephaloziella, both of which have 2-lobed leaves). Species of the genus Kurzia have 3-4 lobed leaves as in L. sandvicensis, but they have shoots that only grow to less than 1 cm in length. Amongst the two other regional species of Lepidozia, L. sandvicensis is the only one with leaves narrow than the shoots on which they grow and it lacks the regular and even branching of L. filamentosa as well as the very close arrangement of leaves seen in L. reptans.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist, usually shady humus, boggy slopes, and streambanks in the lowland zone\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-11-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLepidozia sandvicensis plate"

The shallowly 2-lobed leaves are inserted roughly along the long axis of the stem, with their sharp and tapering apices seperated by a broad and round sinus. Narrow, two-lobed underleaves should be present and the lateral leaves maintain a consistent shape along the length of the stem.\n\nSimilar species\n\nSpecies of Lophozia and Lophoziopsis have superficially similair leaves, but leaves in those species are not attached at their base along the long axis of the stem as in L. bidentata, nor do they have underleaves. Geocalyx graveolens does have nearly identical leaf attachment and bilobed shape, but its lobe tips are triangular, while those of L. bidentata have elongate, narrow tips.

Like other members of its genus, L. minor has shallowly-bilobed leaves, but the lobes are rounded and typically covered in globs of asexual spores (\"gemmae\") that give the leaf a scuzzy look (see photo). This in combination with the narrow, bilobed underleaf make this species possible to recognize in the field with the aide of a hand lens.\n\nSimilar species\n\nBecause of its bilobed leaves, small size and wood-borne lifestyle, L. minor bears some semblance to species of Fuscocephaloziopsis and Lophozia. Lophozia longidens is also a species of decaying wood with asexual spores (\"gemmae\") on the leaves, but those spores are typically red and held in clusters at the tips of the leaf lobes. Furthermore, species of Lophozia lack underleaves. L. minor has narrow, bilobed underleaves and its gemmae are light green and arrayed all along the margins of the leaf. Species of Fuscocephaloziopsis are common on rotting wood and have longitudinal leaf insertion, but they lack the gemmae and bilobed underleaves found in L. minor. Within its genus, L. minor is the smallest and has rounded lobes covered in gemmae, while L. heterophylla has leaves that vary in form as you move along the stem, with some unlobed and those that are lobed varying between sharp and rounded lobe tips, all of which lack gemmae. .

Like all members of the genus, it has a continuous, thin wing of photosynthetic tissue that run along a midrib, but close inspection of the underside reveals pairs of straight hairs along the margins as well as the midrib. You might well see spherical structures under there as well– these are specialized structures that hold the reproductive organs.\n\nSimilar species\n\nAmongst the thalloid bryophytes of the region, it is unlikely to be mistaken for any other genus on account of its small size and thin wings. Species of Riccardia and Fossombronia are of similar size, but the former lacks a midrib and the latter has a ruffled, leafy appearance in contrast to the flattened thallus of M. conjugata. Most other species within the genus Metzgeria can be seperated from it based on features of the hairs. M. americana and M. pubescens have hairs all over both surfaces, while in M. conjugata they are confined to the underside along the margins and midrib. M. leptoneura has a similair arrangement, but in that species, the hairs are curved into a C-shape, not straight. M. temperata can have identical hair arrangement to M. conjugata, but the shoots have tapering tips that are frequently fringed with asexual reproductive bodies (\"gemmae\"). M. lindbergii is impossible to distinguish without a microscope.\n\nHabitat\n\nMesic to wet, usually shady rock outcrops, cliffs, boulders, waterfall spray zones, and tree trunks in the lowland zone; frequent in coastal BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetzgeria conjugata plate"
