The leaf tips are rounded in F. californica, whereas in F. nisquallensis and occasional F. franciscana, they are pointed. In plants of F. franciscana where the leaf tips are rounded, a microscope is neccessary to distinguish it from F. californica based on cellular characters– dark eye spots (\"ocelli\") are present in a line in the former, while they are scattered in the latter."

Like all members of the genus, it has a continuous, thin wing of photosynthetic tissue that run along a midrib, but close inspection of the underside reveals pairs of straight hairs along the margins as well as the midrib.
