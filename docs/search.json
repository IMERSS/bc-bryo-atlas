Up close, the upper leaf segments are distantly spaced on extremely narrow shoots. These stand in contrast to the free shoots branching away from the substrate, which are modified into a whip-like appendage.\n\nSimilar species\n\nNo other species in the region has the whip-like \"flagellate\" shoots growing away from the substrate. The only Frullania species approaching the size of F. bolanderi is F. hattoriana, which is a montane species that, again, lacks the specialized branchlets.\n\nHabitat\n\nTree trunks (esp. deciduous trees, Douglas-fir), branches, decayed wood, and occasionally rocks, humus, and mineral soil in the lowland zone; frequent in sw BC, rare in wc BC [Skeena R.].\n\nAssociated species\n\nRadula complanata, Pulvigera sp., Porella navicularis, Neckera sp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Feb 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrullania bolanderi plate"

It is distinct in having nearly equal upper and lower leaf lobes and a reduced, obscured keel connecting them along their lower margin.\n\nSimilar species\n\nIn the montane to alpine habitat where this species thrives, it is unlikely to be mistaken for many other species on account of its girth and closely overlapping leaves. Some species of Scapania (eg. Scapania subalpina) occuring in the same habitats also have smooth, nearly equal lobes, but in M. imbricatum the lobes are elongate and lack the obvious \"keel\" that connect the upper and lober lobes at their base.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist, often shady rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, heath, and tundra in the montane, subalpine, and alpine zones; infrequent in wc BC [esp. Haida Gwaii], rare in sw, c [Hudson Bay Mtn.], and nw [Haines Triangle] BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"no GBIF data to display\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Feb 26, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacrodiplophyllum imbricatum plate"

When looked at from below, the tips of the upper leaf lobe are rounded and the edges of the underleaf are planar.\n\nSimilar species\n\nAt first glance, this species is hard to distinguish from other Frullania species in the region, but like most liverworts, small but visible details hold the key. F. californica lacks the free \"flagellate\" branchlets of F. bolanderi that stick out so prominently from a similair bark substrate. The leaf tips are rounded in F. californica, whereas in F. nisquallensis and occasional F. franciscana, they are pointed. In plants of F. franciscana where the leaf tips are rounded, a microscope is neccessary to distinguish it from F. californica based on cellular characters– dark eye spots (\"ocelli\") are present in a line in the former, while they are scattered in the latter.\n\nHabitat\n\nTree trunks (esp. deciduous trees, cedar), branches, decayed wood, rock outcrops, and cliffs in the lowland zone; infrequent in coastal BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Feb 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrullania californica plate"

In the wet, organic-rich habitats it seems to thrive in, it grows horizontally and close to its substrate, with numerous branches of the thallus emerging from a jagged main axis like a bolt of bryological lightening. Microscopically, the presence of abundant oil bodies in its surface cells as well as the oval shape of the thallus in cross section help distinguish it from other regional species within the genus Riccardia.\n\nSimilar species\n\nR. chamedryfolia is large enough to pass for a skinny Aneura, but that genus is unbranched or little-branched and its thallus segments are more than 2mm wide. R. chamedryfolia is much branched and the thallus segments are less than 2 mm wide. Aneura also has a characteristic turpentine smell to the freshly-rubbed thallus that is absent and Riccardia. Amongst other members of its genus, it is most similair to R. multifida on account of its similair branching, but in that species, a wing of thin tissue surrounds the thallus and oil bodies are scant, while in R. chamedryfolia, the thallus is succulent, unwinged and oil bodies are abundant in fresh material.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet, shady mineral soil, humus, swamps, streambanks, shorelines, and decayed wood, occasionally submerged in shallow water, in the lowland zone\n\nAssociated species\n\nChiloscyphus polyanthos, Pellia neesiana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 25, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiccardia chamedryfolia plate"

It has two-subequal and toothless lobes that spread away from one another with acute apices and a linear and sharply folded keel. The lower lobe attaches to the shoot with a long decurrency that runs down the stem axis. Under the microscope, this species has rounded globules of wax on the external surfaces of its leaf cells, as well as triangular thickenings in the corners where adjacent cells abut one another.\n\nSimilar species\n\nIn macro view, this species has similarities to Sphenolobus minutus and Marsupella emarginat, both species with small shoots with alternating and seemingly evenly 2-lobed leaves. In those species, however, the leaves always attach across the axis of the stem, not down along it as is the case for the lower (and slightly smaller!) lobe of S. hians. Among species of Pacific Northwest Scapania, only S. simmonsii, S. obscura and S. subalpina can have subequal lobes with a decurrent base on the lower lobe and an acute, linear keel as in S. hians. Of the found, only S. simmonsii has the large globular wax thickenings visible on the outer walls of leaf cells under the micrscope as can be seen in S. hians. S. simmonsii, however is a much larger northern species of calcareous soils and its leaf lobes turn down along their free edges, while S. hians in our region is a species of silt over rocks in subalpine streams and has lobes that are divergent with upwards facing margins.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, humus, and streambanks, sometimes submerged in flowing water, in the montane and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScapania hians plate"

Geocalyx graveolens does can have nearly identical leaf attachment and shape, but its leaves are consistent in shape along the stem and its lobe tips are always triangular, while leaves of L. heterophylla are variable in shape as you move along the stem, often without lobes or having lobes that are more blunt or more acute than those found in Geocalyx. Species of Mesoptychia (especially M. gillmanii) can show similair leaf shape, but leaves in that genus are attached across the axis of the stem, not along it, and underleaves are unlobed, whereas in L. heterophylla, they are bilobed. Within its genus, L. minor is smaller and has leaves with regularly rounded lobes covered in asexual spores (\"gemmae\"), while L. heterophylla has leaves that vary in form as you move along the stem and lacks gemmae.

It is a complex thalloid liverwort with short, overlapping segments to about 1cm wide and 3 cm long that grow prostrate over fine soils and almost always have semicircular cups on the upper surface that house and disperse asexual spores (\"gemmae cups\", see photo). Sporophytes have not been observed in regional material, but in the event that the gemmae cups are absent, attention should be paid to the simple pores on the thallus and the brown colour of the scales on its underside.\n\nSimilar species\n\nWhen gemmae cups are present, L. cruciata can only be mistaken for Marchantia polymorpha, but in that species the cups are circular, not semicircular or crescent shaped as they are in Lunularia. The weedy habitat is a good clue for plants of L. cruciata that lack gemmae cups, but the simple pores are a good backup feature: the presence of simple pores distinguishes Lunularia from species of Marchantia, which have compound pores, while the presence of brown scales on the underside of L. cruciata seperate it from other complex thalloid genera with simple pores (Mannia, Reboulia, Clevea, Targionia), where the scales are purple or white.\n\nHabitat\n\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunularia cruciata plate"

Microscopic examination should be used to confirm this latter character as well as the presence of oil bodies.\n\nSimilar species\n\nSphenolobopsis, Marsupella, Cephalozia and Fuscocephaloziopsis can be of similair size and leaf form, but the leaves in those genera are wider than the stems and have oil bodies, while in C. divaricata oil bodies are lacking and the leaves are narrower than the stem. Eremonotus myriocarpus is very similar in size, leaf shape and threadlike growth habit. It grows in the very specific habitat of damp vertical rock, but otherwise requires granular examination of the shoots to compare leaf shapes and reproductive structures- see photos under that species. Other species of Cephaloziella (C. phyllacantha, C. spinigera, C. turneri, C. elachista) in this region have leaves divided almost to their bases in addition to prominent teeth along the leaf margins. Vegetative leaves of C. divaricata are divided to about half their length and typically without teeth. The remaining species will need to be parsed based on the arrngement of their reproductive organs. In Cephaloziella divaricata, the modified leafy structures that bear the archegonia (\"gynoecia\") and antheridia (\"androecia\"), while in C. rubellum, C. varians and C. hampeana, they can be found on the same shoots.\n\nHabitat\n\nXXXXXX\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCephaloziella divaricata plate"

The center of the thallus is thickened and and often darker than the margins, which tend to undulate. The antheridia appear as aggregates of small bumps on thallus segments of male plants, while the archegonia and sporophytes develop within a smooth-margined tubular flap of tissue on a seperate female plant. In the spring, mature sporophytes can rise to an impressive height of 10 cm or more.\n\nSimilar species\n\nSpecies of Moerckia have large, simple thalli, but are typically adorned with abundant scales on the upper surface. Such scales are absent in Pellia. Calycularia is similair, but has prominent pink-purple scales that can be seen with a hand lens on the underside of the thallus; these are likewise absent in P. neesiana. Apopellia alpicola is a subalpine and alpine species that has a very dissected tube (\"pseudoperianth\") surrounding its developing sporophyte. P. neesiana can occur at higher elevations, but the pseudoperianth is stubbier and its margins are mostly smooth. P. epiphylla has antheridia and archegonia on the same plant (monoicous); in P. neesiana they are on seperate plants (dioicous). It is most likely to be confused with similairly dioicous P. columbiana, but in that species, the flap of tissue surrounding the developing archegonia and sporophytes has an incised, tattered & toothed margin relative to the smooth outer margin of this structure in P. neesiana.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet, shady mineral soil, forested depressions, rock outcrops, boulders, ledges, cliffs,  streambanks, shorelines, seepage areas, marshes, ditches, and disturbed areas, often  submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nRhizomnium glabrescens, Rhizomnium magnifolium, Kindbergia praelonga, Hookeria lucens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 25, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPellia neesiana plate"

With a hand lens, you should be able to make out 3 key features: (1) the elongate aspects of the unequal upper and lower leaf lobes (2) the point of convergence between the two lobes (\"the keel\") is gently rounded, not sharply folded and (3) The presence of a sharp point at the tip of the lower lobe (see photo). The plant is often laden with green, asexual repoductive bodies (\"gemmae\") that are two-celled in under the microscope.\n\nSimilar species\n\nThe combination of a rounded keel and pointed tip on the lower leaf lobe makes this small species hard to confuse with any other Scapania with the exception of S. apiculata, a plant found exlusively on decaying wood to which S. mucronata is almost macroscopically identical. The upper leaf lobe in S. apiculata is one-half as wide as it is long, while the upper leaf lobe in S. mucronata is roughly greater than two-thirds as wide as it is long. Furthermore, the gemmae, when present and examined under the microscope, are one-celled in the former species and two-celled in the latter.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, decayed wood, seepage areas, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 22, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScapania mucronata plate"

Species of Frullania can be very small, but hand lens or microscope inspection of their undersides show the presence of an underleaf and \"lobule\", whereas R. bolanderi lacks both features and has a small pocket at the base of its leaf. The very rare Cololejeunea macounii also has sub-mm-wide shoots and distant leaves with a pocket at their bottom, but close microscopic inspection of that species shows teeth on the pocket.

The tips of the lateral leaves are rounded or blunt, occasionally with a shallow and round notch, while the underleaves are very narrow but discernably two-lobed with a hand lens.

Alternately, you can look to make sure that there are typically 2 oil bodies per leaf cell.\n\nSimilar species\n\nThe longitudinal attachment of blunt, simple leaves in habitats that often host water winnows the list of liverworts for which this could be confused. Gyrothyra underwoodiana is a species of wet banks with similair leaves and leaf attchment, but its undersides have a characteristic set of discrete purple \"pads\" that are absent in Chiloscyphus pallescens. Species of Jungermannia and Solenostoma have simple leaves, but they are attached at a more oblique angle and both genera lack the underleaves of Chiloscyphus. Species of Plagiochila can have similair oblique-longitudinal attachment of unlobed leaves, but those leaves typically have teeth and the plants never have an underleaf. C. pallescens has an underleaf and its leaves are unadorned. Lophocolea heterophylla typically has leaves showing variable degrees of lobing along the length of the stem, but when the leaves are unlobed, they can look like Chiloscyphus, but C. pallescens does not show much variation in leaf form along the stem. Chiloscyphus polyanthos has leaves and stems that are morphologically indistinguishable from C. pallescens. Close inspection of the leaves surrounding the archegonia in fertile material should show smooth leaf margins in the former and teeth on the latter, while microscopic examination will show most leaf cells of C. polyanthos have 2 oil bodies, while those of C. pallescens mostly have 2 oil bodies.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, decayed wood, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, and seepage sites, often submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChiloscyphus polyanthos plate"

Both Mylia taylorii and M. anomala can grow between Sphagnum, but both species have large (&gt;2mm) oval-shaped leaves that point upwards, whereas those of C. sphagnicola are small (&lt;1mm), rounded-triangular and tend to point out at 90 degrees from the stem.

The thallus can grow between 2-5 cm long and 2-6 mm wide, having a characteristic greasy texture when its fresh tissues are rubbed. The thallus, though thickest in the center (10-to-20 cells thick), lacks an obvious midrib and tapers gradually towards its margins (1-to-3 cells thick). Under the microscope, oil bodies are colourless and abundant (6-to-20 per cell). The male and female plants are seperate; sporophytes, when present, emerge from the underside of the plant.\n\nSimilar species\n\nBecause of its amorphous and thick thallus, A. pinguis could be mistaken for many other bryophytes. It has a thallus not dissimilair to the hornworts Anthoceros and Phaeoceros, but those two genera have thalli that form brached rosettes and bear pyrenoids in their cells, large photosynthetic apparati that are absent in the mostly linear thalli of Aneura. Species of Pellia are similar in form, but have a more pronounced midrib and lack the turpentine smell of fresh Aneura. It should also be noted that sporophytes are produced along the upper surface in the former but emerge from the underside of the thallus in the latter.

The tips of the lateral leaves are rounded or blunt, occasionally with a shallow and round notch, while the underleaves are very narrow but discernably two-lobed with a hand lens. When fertile, this species has archegonia and antheridia on seperate plants; species recognition here requires observation of the leaves surrounding the archegonium, which should be toothed at their tip. Alternately, you can look to make sure that there are typically 3 oil bodies per leaf cell.\n\nSimilar species\n\nThe longitudinal attachment of blunt, simple leaves in habitats that often host water winnows the list of liverworts for which this could be confused. Gyrothyra underwoodiana is a species of wet banks with similair leaves and leaf attchment, but its undersides have a characteristic set of discrete purple \"pads\" that are absent in Chiloscyphus pallescens. Species of Jungermannia and Solenostoma have simple leaves, but they are attached at a more oblique angle and both genera lack the underleaves of Chiloscyphus. Species of Plagiochila can have similair oblique-longitudinal attachment of unlobed leaves, but those leaves typically have teeth and the plants never have an underleaf. C. pallescens has an underleaf and its leaves are unadorned. Lophocolea heterophylla typically has leaves showing variable degrees of lobing along the length of the stem, but when the leaves are unlobed, they can look like Chiloscyphus, but C. pallescens does not show much variation in leaf form along the stem. Chiloscyphus polyanthos has leaves and stems that are morphologically indistinguishable from C. pallescens. Close inspection of the leaves surrounding the archegonia in fertile material should show smooth leaf margins in the former and teeth on the latter, while microscopic examination will show most leaf cells of C. polyanthos have 2 oil bodies, while those of C. pallescens mostly have 2 oil bodies.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, mineral soil, rock outcrops, cliffs, decayed wood, bogs, swamps, shorelines, streambanks, and seepage sites, often submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChiloscyphus pallescens plate"

Gyrothyra underwoodiana has the same widespreading and subopposite leave arrangement, but its underleaf is two-lobed and the undersides of the stem have recurrent purple patches in contrast to the to M. taylorii where such patches are absent and the underleaves are unlobed.

M. taylorii is a much bigger plant and its leaves are plane, not concave. Nardia has shoots that can show the nested lip arrangement of rounded leaves seen in M. taylorii, but it never has gemmae and its underleaf, while similair in shape, is attached to the base of the lateral leaves. In M. taylorii, the underleaves are free from the lateral leaves and gemmae are very common.

With a hand lens, the 3-4-lobes of each leaf are sharply tipped, converging at a leaf base that diverges from the stem at 90 degrees. In order confidently identify this species, a microscope is neccessary to observe the underleaves, which are typically reduced to 1-2 lobes accompanied by 1-2 amorphous bumps (\"slime papillae\"– see photograph).\n\nSimilar species\n\nSorting out species of Kurzia is always going to require high magnification on account of their small size. On account of its small size and tiny, almost filamentous leaf-lobes, K. makinoana can be mistaken for species of Blepharostoma or Lepidozia, both of which can occur in the same habitats. Blepharostoma species have leaf lobes that are 1-cell wide and divided completely to the base of the leaf. In K. makinoana, the lobes are 1-celled at their tip but broaden to 2 (or more) cells towards their base, which is found at about three-quarters down the leaf’s length. Lepidozia species have 3-4 lobed lateral leaves, the leaf itself being divided only to about 1/2 its length into lobes that are 4+ cells wide at their base. Kurzia pauciflora is a species exclusive to open bogs and has 4-lobed underleaves compared to the wider ecological range and 1-2 lobed underleaves of K. makinoana. Distinguishing K. trichoclados requires microscopic examination of the ornamentation of the leaves surrounding the developing reproductive organs.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet humus, rock outcrops, cliffs, ledges, decayed wood, seepage sites, streambanks, peatlands, bogs, and swamps in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 9, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzia makinoana plate"

While its lateral leaves have the genus’ characteristic 3-4 triangular lobes down to about 1/2 their length, they are narrower than the shoot width and very widely spaced along the stems. As the Latin name suggests, this is a plant with an interesting distribution, known predominantly from the Hawaiian Islands and wet-coastal British Columbia.\n\nSimilar species\n\nBecause of its large size and shoots growing free from their substrate, it is unlikely to be mistaken for other liverworts with leaves narrower than their stems (eg. species of Cephalozia and Cephaloziella, both of which have 2-lobed leaves). Species of the genus Kurzia have 3-4 lobed leaves as in L. sandvicensis, but they have shoots that only grow to less than 1 cm in length.

Like all members of the genus, it has a continuous, thin wing of photosynthetic tissue that run along a midrib, but close inspection of the underside reveals pairs of straight hairs along the margins as well as the midrib. You might well see spherical structures under there as well– these are specialized structures that hold the reproductive organs.\n\nSimilar species\n\nAmongst the thalloid bryophytes of the region, it is unlikely to be mistaken for any other genus on account of its small size and thin wings. Species of Riccardia and Fossombronia are of similar size, but the former lacks a midrib and the latter has a ruffled, leafy appearance in contrast to the flattened thallus of M. conjugata. Most other species within the genus Metzgeria can be seperated from it based on features of the hairs. M. americana and M. pubescens have hairs all over both surfaces, while in M. conjugata they are confined to the underside along the margins and midrib. M. leptoneura has a similair arrangement, but in that species, the hairs are curved into a C-shape, not straight. M. temperata can have identical hair arrangement to M. conjugata, but the shoots have tapering tips that are frequently fringed with asexual reproductive bodies (\"gemmae\").

Typically a dark, mottled green, it has a thickened vein-like region running down the middle of the thallus that gradulally tapers into the thin, undulating margins that are one cell thick.

Such scales are absent in Pellia. Calycularia is similair, but has prominent pink-purple scales that can be seen with a hand lens on the underside of the thallus; these are likewise absent in P. columbiana.

P. epiphylla has antheridia and archegonia on the same plant (monoicous); in P. columbiana they are on seperate plants (dioicous). It is most likely to be confused with similairly dioicous P. neesiana, but in that species, the flap of tissue surrounding the developing archegonia and sporophytes has a smooth outer margin compared to the incised, tattered & toothed margin of this structure in P. columbiana.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet, shady mineral soil, streambanks, and ditches in the lowland zone\n\nAssociated species\n\nRhizomnium glabrescens, Rhizomnium magnifolium, Kindbergia praelonga, Hookeria lucens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"no GBIF data to display\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 25, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPellia columbiana plate"

Typically tightly appressed to decaying conifers and organic-rich soils, this species can be confirmed by hand lens examination of the underleaf, which should show two lobes that are divided to about half of their length. Like many species in the genus, C. mulleriana frequently has gemmae-bearing shoots that have more distant leaves and erect shoot apices with light-green clusters of asexual spores.\n\nSimilar species\n\nCalypogeia mulleriana is unlikely to be confused with any other genus of leafy liverworts with the exception of Bazzania, which can show similair shingle-like arrangement of leaves. That genus, however, has leaves that have tooth-like notches at the tips and underleaves with more than two lobes. The green, rounded leaves and evenly two-lobed underleaves of C. mulleriana are similair to many species in the genus Calypogeia, but can be distinguished from other species with a hand lens. Plants of C. azurea have identical leaves and underleaves, but have a blue hue, while C. sphagnicola has leaves that are triangular in shape and do not overlap, whereas leaves in C. mulleriana are round and tightly overlap. C. integrispula and C. neesiana have unlobed underleaves and C. fissa has an underleaf dissected almost all the way to its base, while the underleaf in C. mulleriana is only dissected to about half of its length. C. suecica, a rare species of wet wood, is very small (typically &lt;1 mm wide) and has somewhat pointed underleaves relative to the rounded underleaves of C. meulleriana, which occur on shoots typically &gt;2 mm wide.\n\nHabitat\n\nDecaying wood and organic rich soil banks in forests\n\nAssociated species\n\nLepidozia reptans, Bazzania denudata, Tetraphis pellucidam Pseudotaxiphyllum elegans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: November 4, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalypogeia muelleriana plate"

The flaccid shoots are little-branched and elongate (to 4 mm wide, 3+ cm long) and vary from green to red to purple and almost black, with the uneven and ellipsoidal leaf lobes becoming tightly appressed to one another near the shoot tip. Leaf lobes can be toothed or untoothed and the upper lobe varies from about 1/3rd to 2/3rds the length of the lower lobe, the two lobes converging along a sharp fold (\"keel\") that is about 1/3 the length of the lower lobe.\n\nSimilar species\n\nScapania uliginosa and S. paludicola can be found in similair wet habitats, but both of those species have an arched keel, while the keel in S. undulata lacks the dramatic arch. Because it is a highly variable species in terms of color and the presence and absence of teeth, care should be taken to note the attachment of the upper and lower lobes to the stem. The upper lobe attaches directly across the stem (\"non-decurrent\") while the lower lobe attachment runs down the length of the stem (\"decurrent\"). When teeth are present, these attachments help distinguish it from Scapania americana, which has an upper lobe that is decurrent. S. subalpina and S. obscura have similair lobe attachments and smooth margins, but their upper lobes are &gt;&gt;3/4 the size of their lower lobes, whilst in S. undulata, the upper lobe is &lt; 2/3rds the size of the lower lobe.\n\nHabitat\n\nMoist to wet mineral soil, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, streambanks, waterfall spray zones, bogs, and seepage sites, often submerged in shallow water, in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScapania undulata plate"

The lateral leaves are wider than the stem and composed of 3 or 4 triangular lobes that are divided to less than 1/2 the leaf’s length.\n\nSimilar species\n\nIn its habitat on decaying wood and tree trunks, it could be mistaken for species of Cephalozia and Fuscocephaloziopsis, but those all have 2-lobed leaves, whereas in L. reptans, the leaves are 3-to-4 lobed. Within the family Lepidoziaceae, species of Bazzania can have lateral leaves that are also 3-lobed, but the lobes are very shallow and constrained to the tips of the leaves, while in Lepidozia reptans, the lobes descend to about 1/2 the leaf’s length. Species of Kurzia have fuzzy-looking shoots about 1/4 mm in width and 3-to-4 linear leaf lobes descending to about 3/4ths of the way down. In L. reptans, the leaves are also 3-to-4 lobed, but the lobes are triangular, not linear, and descent to about 1/2 of the leaf’s length. It is most likely to be confused with the two other regional species of Lepidozia. L. sandvicensis has identical leaf shape, but the leaves themselves are narrower than the shoot and arranged very distantly from one another; leaves of L. reptans are wider than the shoot and are closely spaced to one another. It is most similair to Lepidozia filamentosa, but that XXXXXX\n\nHabitat\n\nWell-decayed wood, humus, tree trunks, and streambanks in the lowland and montane zones\n\nAssociated species\n\nXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\n\nLast updated: Nov 9, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLepidozia reptans plate"
