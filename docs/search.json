When lifted from the water or surface sediments, the dark underside is laden with long, black, root-like tangles, and the uppoer surface is marked by faint polygons. As the margin of a water body receeds, this species can live out its days on wet mud, often growing upwards of 2-3 cm wide.\n\nSimilar species\n\nUnmistakeable while floating in open water, it is likely to cause a little confusion if found living on sediments or soils where water has stranded it. Riccia sorocarpa is furrowed, too, but lacks the black bottoms and polygonal patterning of the upper surface that is found in Ricciocarpos. Other thalloid liverworts found in similar habitats, such as Marchantia polymorpha and Conocephalum sp. have more clearly delimited polygons and lack the large black root-like structures on their undersides.\n\nHabitat\n\nFloating on the surface of nutrient- and mineral-rich water in marshes, ponds, ditches, lakeshores, and slow-moving streams, or stranded on shoreline mud, in the lowland, steppe, and montane zones; infrequent east of the Coast-Cascade Mts. and in sw BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\nRiccia frostii, Riccia cavernosa, Physcomitrium patens, Ephemerum serrulatum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicciocarpos natans plate"

Closer inspection reveals a deep and pervasive furrow in the thallus, that, in combination with its unadorned and green underside, makes it relatively easy to recognize when mature. At later stages, the upper surface of the plant begins to degrade and rupture such that the black capsules embedded within the thallus reveal themselves and release their spores.\n\nSimilar species\n\nRicciocarpos natans, a species of fallow water and its margins, can also exhibit deep furrows across a rosette-forming thallus, but that species has dark underside marked by elongate black root-like structures. Other species within the genus Riccia have porous upper surfaces (see: R. cavernosa, R. frostii), or are adorned by hairs and scales near the margin of the thallus (R. trichocarpa, R. beyrichiana, R. lamellosa).

The margins are frequently populated by round gemmae (see photo) and the undersides lack underleaves but are marked by a small pocket at the base of the leaf. When fertile, you should see little envelope shaped structures that enclose the developing sporophyte.\n\nSimilar species\n\nCould be confused with Porella, Frullania or even Chiloscyphus, but all those genera have underleaves, a feature missing in Radula species. R. complanata often grows alongside the much smaller R. bolanderi, the latter of which has vegetative leaves that barely overlap and male shoots that have a distinctive strap-like appearance. R. obtusiloba and R. auriculata have similar leaf sizes and shapes, but tend to grow free from their substrate abd exhibit much more regular branching than the appressed R. complanata.\n\nHabitat\n\nTree trunks, branches, rock outcrops, boulders, cliffs, and occasionally humus in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones; common in sw BC, frequent northward along the coast and in se BC, rare in sc, c, and n [east to the Rocky Mts.] BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadula complanata plate"

The sporophyte capsules have a long beak, and sit atop a roughened stalk.\n\nSimilar species\n\nNo other species with feathered branches has such evenly spaced branches. The closest lookalike is Kindbergia praelonga, which has a more wispy habit with less regular branching. See also: Homalothecium, Isothecium, Kindbergia praelonga, Bracythecium, Claopodium, Ptilium. Similar feather-like growth habits are common in forest floor habitats, but in genera like Hypnum, Stereodon, Ptilium, Sanionia, the leaves are curled whereas in Kinbergia oregana they are flat/straight; the robust golden shoots of Homalothecium megaptilum have tightly overlapping leaves and more distantly-space branches. Claopodium crispifolium can be found in very similar environments on tree bases, but its dull white leaf tips come off at 90 degree angles and look like Christmas tree ornaments on the end of each shoot, while the green tipped Kindbergia oregana has leaves that point forward.\n\nHabitat\n\nSeasonally wet, usually shady mineral soil, humus, boulders, rock outcrops, ledges, crevices, rock faces, decayed wood, tree bases, branches, trails, roadsides, and disturbed areas, especially in coniferous forests, in the lowland and montane zones; common in coastal BC, rare in se BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\nHomalothecium megaptilum, Plagiothecium undulatum, Rhytidiadelphus loreus, Leucolepis acanthoneura, Hylocomiadelphus triquetrus, Hylocomium splendens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell, John Reynolds, Brian Starzomski, Daniel Tucker\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKindbergia oregana plate"

From above, the plant is composed of tightly overlapping, round upper lobes on their leaves. Looked at from below with a hand lens, you should be able to make out the upper leaf lobes coming to a sharp point at their apex and the small, helmet-shaped \"lobule\" that rests underneath it.\n\nSimilar species\n\nSometimes this can be mistaken for species of Porella, but in that genus, the little helmet-shaped \"lobule\" present in Frullania is absent. Likewise, Radula can also grow as a small epiphyte growing close to the bark, but in that genus, there is no \"lobule\", nor is there the prominent underleaf found in species of Frullania. F. nisquallensis is the \"largest\" species in the genus, but could be mistaken for similar epiphytic forms of F. californica and rock-dwelling Frullania franciscana. Those species typically lack the sharp points found on the upper leaf lobe tips in F. nisquallensis. Barring that, miscoscopic study might be neccessary to distinguish it from these species.\n\nHabitat\n\nTree trunks (esp. alder, maple), branches, decayed wood, humus, mineral soil, cliffs, and rock outcrops in the lowland and lower montane zones; common in coastal BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\nPorella navicularis, Porella cordeana, Radula complanata, Radula bolanderi, Frullania bolanderi, Pulvigera sp., Orthotrichum pulchellum, Neckera sp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrullania nisquallensis plate"

Like all members of the genus, it has a continuous, thin wing of photosynthetic tissue that run along a midrib, but close inspection of the underside reveals pairs of straight hairs along the margins as well as the midrib. You might well see spherical structures under there as well– these are specialized structures that hold the reproductive organs.\n\nSimilar species\n\nAmongst the thalloid bryophytes of the region, it is unlikely to be mistaken for any other genus on account of its small size and thin wings. Species of Riccardia and Fossombronia are of similar size, but the former lacks a midrib and the latter has a ruffled, leafy appearance in contrast to the flattened thallus of M. conjugata. Most other species within the genus Metzgeria can be seperated from it based on features of the hairs. M. americana and M. pubescens have hairs all over both surfaces, while in M. conjugata they are confined to the underside along the margins and midrib. M. leptoneura has a similair arrangement, but in that species, the hairs are curved into a C-shape, not straight.

Other species of Racomitrium (R. elongatum, R. ericoides, R. muticum, and R. canescens) are similar in growth form but the large serrated teeth on the leaf tips of R. lanuginosum separate it from all others.\n\nHabitat\n\nDry, open, rocky habitats; also bog and tundra hummocks, and mineral soil from lowlands to alpine; common in coastal BC, infrequent elsewhere east of the Coast-Cascade Mts. [except absent from ne BC east of the Rocky Mountains].\n\nAssociated species\n\nDepends on habitat but in rocky areas commonly with Racomitrium elongatum, R. heterostichum, Polytrichum piliferum, P. juniperinum, P. commune, Dicranum howellii, D. scoparium; in bogs Sphagnum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell, John Reynolds, Brian Starzomski, Daniel Tucker\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacomitrium lanuginosum plate"

It is most easily recognized by the presence of male shoots with tightly overlapping leaves and a perfect pleat down the middle (see photo).\n\nSimilar species\n\nWith its small size, R. bolanderi only overlaps with the most miniscule of epiphytes in its habitat. Species of Frullania can be very small, but hand lens or microscope inspection of their undersides show the presence of an underleaf and \"lobule\", whereas R. bolanderi lacks both features and has a small pocket at the base of its leaf. The very rare Cololejeunea macounii also has sub-mm-wide shoots and distant leaves with a pocket at their bottom, but close microscopic inspection of that species shows teeth on the pocket. In R. bolanderi, the margin of the pocket is smooth.\n\nHabitat\n\nTree trunks, rock outcrops, and cliffs in the lowland, montane, and subalpine zones; frequent in coastal BC.\n\nAssociated species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Randal Mindell\n\n\nLast updated: 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadula bolanderi plate"
